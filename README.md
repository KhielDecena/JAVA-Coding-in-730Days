# 💻 Java Learning Roadmap (Beginner → Advanced)

Welcome to my **Java Programming Journey**! 🚀
This repository serves as a structured learning path for mastering Java — from basic syntax to advanced concepts like multithreading, generics, and design patterns.

Each topic is organized into three levels for easier progression:

---

## 🟢 BEGINNER LEVEL (1–30)

Start with the fundamentals — from installation, syntax, and variables to arrays, loops, and basic exception handling. Perfect for those new to Java programming.

### 📘Topics

- Introduction to Java

- Java Installation and Setup (JDK, JRE, IDE)

- Java Syntax and Structure

- Variables and Data Types

- Constants and Literals

- Input and Output (Scanner class)

- Operators (Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Assignment)

- Type Casting

- If–Else Statements

- Nested If–Else

- Switch Statement

- Loops (for, while, do-while)

- Break and Continue

- Arrays (1D)

- Arrays (2D)

- String Basics

- String Methods (length, charAt, substring, etc.)

- StringBuilder and StringBuffer

- Methods (Functions)

- Method Overloading

- Scope of Variables

- Static and Non-Static Methods

- Recursion

- Random Numbers in Java

- Basic Math Class Functions

- Comments and Documentation

- Using Packages (import)

- Simple Programs (sum, factorial, palindrome, etc.)

- Debugging Basics

- Basic Exception (try-catch)

---

## 🟡 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (31–65)
### 📘Topics
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

- Classes and Objects

- Constructors

- Constructor Overloading

- this Keyword

- Instance vs. Class Variables

- Encapsulation (Getters and Setters)

- Inheritance

- super Keyword

- Method Overriding

- Polymorphism

- Abstract Classes

- Interfaces

- Final Keyword

- Static Keyword (Methods, Variables, Blocks)

- Inner Classes

- Anonymous Classes

- Enumerations (enum)

- Packages (Creating and Using)

- Access Modifiers (public, private, protected, default)

- Wrapper Classes (Integer, Double, etc.)

- Autoboxing and Unboxing

- ArrayList

- LinkedList

- HashMap

- HashSet and TreeSet

- Stack and Queue

- Collections Framework Overview

- Iterator and ListIterator

- for-each Loop

- File Handling (Read/Write)

- Exception Handling (try, catch, finally, throws, throw)

- Custom Exceptions

- StringTokenizer

- Date and Time (LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime)

- Dive deeper into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, collections, file handling, and exception management. Build strong foundations for professional Java development.

- Synchronization

- Thread Communication (wait, notify, notifyAll)

- Runnable Interface

- Executor Framework

- Concurrency Utilities (Locks, Semaphores)

- Java I/O Streams (InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer)

- BufferedReader and BufferedWriter

- FileReader and FileWriter

- Scanner vs. BufferedReader

- Networking (Socket Programming)

- Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)

- CRUD Operations using JDBC

- PreparedStatement

- ResultSet and Metadata

- JavaFX Basics

- Swing GUI Basics

- Event Handling in GUI

- Layout Managers

- Unit Testing (JUnit)

- Maven and Project Management

- JSON and XML Parsing

- Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)

- Best Practices and Code Optimization in Java
